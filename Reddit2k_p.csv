1,I feel so much fear and anxiety all the time. I live in Oregon. My dad works in downtown Portland. He eats all the conservative propaganda and thinks Iâm an idiot for being concerned about the mysterious federal police force roaming the streets capturing people in vans.  My dad now due to people being laid off now has to essentially do security in addition to his job. Square in the middle of downtown Portland. Itâs a little worrying to me and especially my mom. Every day he sends me shit complaining about the protestors and will show me graffiti he has to clean up and anytime I show him police brutality he is gleeful and doesnât care. My mom is suicidal now too thatâs a new development. Things have escalated and our family is just really frustrated with how unempathetic he seems. I know that seems dumb but man things are hard right now and like Iâve  been suicidal since I was like 11 and Iâm 24 now. Thatâs not really relevant just like damn am Iâm having an extra bad time I was mentally strained before this. I need peace in my family. Does anyone have any links I can send or show my dad in person (when I text him he doesnât listen) to maybe change his mind?,2020PoliceBrutality,I need peace in my family.

7,"The primary purpose of this group is to showcase police brutality.I come from a mixed family (you name it, we got it). My grandmother is a person of color. I fear for my family every single time I hear about police violence.I called my grandmother to express this. It was the first time we had a real conversation about race. It was a  hard conversation to have - we weren't addressing my fears!She said, ""Dave, it is so dangerous being a black man in America. Don't personalize it.""And that's just it. I personalize a problem I shouldn't. That conversation helped me identify what I can - and should - take responsibility for. Identification is only the first step in the process of healing.I have to believe that it will get better. I have to believe in something bigger than mr. I have to relinquish control of the things I cannot. It is hard, especially when I believe I, myself, am the difference. It's not so simple...In fear, I lose track of who I am and the principles I live by. I have to take an honest, fearless look at myself. It is not easy, but helps with identifying my part. I need to share these things with someone I trust - anyone or anything, even the spiritual. I'm fortunate to have close friends and professionals I can discuss these things with and some conception of a Universal power that will listen. I learn more about myself when I listen to these things. I have to pray that the defaults of character which affect my usefulness to others can be removed, but first I have to be willing. Identifying what's what in this sense requires time and meditative practice. One way or another, I may have caused harm to someone else, and I need to be willing to make amends - and then do it. I'm not perfect, sometimes I slip. I should be accountable for such occurrences.In the meantime, I take a moment to pause and reflect - is there something I'm not doing? What is the next best thing - good orderly direction? How can I be of service How can I further connect with this Universal power?Lastly, I have to carry this on - to help those who are suffering. I don't know if this is the solution for you, but so far, it has worked for me.If you - any of you - have any questions, feel free to DM me.",2020PoliceBrutality,How do you cope with the emotions of subscribing to this sub?

Hard to wrap your mind around tbh. Caregiver fatigue is what you are referencing when you say âI wanted to do more, but I couldnât handle it for a long period of timeâ, in my opinion. Caring, in general, in the face of such cruelty will definitely drain an empathetic person rather quickly. I ran an animal rescue for a couple years ago, and that definitely prepared me for the difficulty of this. I seem to have the ability to deal with almost anything as long as Iâm feeling like Iâm doing something about it. If Iâm sitting still the cruelty hurts me *far* more â I get stagnant and frustrated. My involvement in the project is what saves me. The team is legitimately such a positive influence in my life that Iâm grateful to be in such a positive environment, surrounded by like-minded people.

I wouldn't fully disagree with your opinion that people are ill adapted to be happy if they lost a lot of what's considered essential within our culture.

That people will be miserable if denied 100% of it. And I really don't think that's the case. Our culture provides a comfortable but less than happy environment for most people right now. Where we all have most of the tools needed for a happy and fulfilling life but where few are going to actually ever have it. I think in large part because almost nobody strikes out on a frightening and unsure endeavor when they have a full belly and a quiet place to sleep at night. Push people out of that and again, I'd agree that a lot of people would beg for what had been taken away.

They're disgusting and toxic with how they're currently able to exploit workers to maximize profits and buy politicians so that they can protect amd maximize said exploitation.That said, it would be very detrimental if every company was expected to save enough money to be able to afford payroll and benefits for an indeterminate ammount of time, which is what we're looking at right now. There's no guaranteed timeline right now.Think about how many people are employed by the currently struggling companies. Now think about how much it would cost to pay those enployees' salaries and benefits for, say, three months. That is an insane ammount of money just sitting in a bank account somewhere that could be used for innovation and expansion. The government should be there to bail out companies in a crisis provided the company didnt have a hand in creating the very crisis that they need to be bailed out from. Of course, there should be oversight and strings attatched to that money so that it doesn't result in massive executive bonuses and stock buybacks while also paying off large swathes of their workforce. Rather than attack the companies directly we need to realize that while disgusting and toxic, what they are doing is legal. We need to regulate this behaviour out and increase worker pay. Companies care about one thing, profit. So they will do anything they can to minimize their costs. With proper regulations in place, workers can be guaranteed a livable wage and benefits such as paid time off and retirement(I currently believe we at least need to decouple health insurance from employment and provide a public option to compete with the health insurance companies, but that isn't the current subject).To get there from here, we need to vote out the bought politicians and get ones in that have the moral backbone to pass the legislation that will break the current cycle of massive amounts of dark corporate money in politics.",ABoringDystopia,And yet they manage our life,molotron,2020-03-24 12:36,1

We all sound like martyrs about it.

We sometimes even one-up each other about our busyness.When I tell someone about my crushing workload, theyâre impressed that I can handle so much. I admit, it feels good for a second. But then I realize how fucking gross it is to take pride in being overworked. Iâm not having a good time every day with the amount of shit I have to do. This is not brag worthy.Even worse: we sometimes glorify stress. I bet you know people in your lifeâ or, youâre one of them yourself, and youâd be in good companyâ who brags about your stress level or how your stress has made you unhealthy in some way, mentally or physically. I know I used to do that. I still catch myself doing it. Itâs hard to unlearn.Iâm so baffled at the fact that weâve managed to condition ourselves to think that being overworked and stressed and unhealthy is a badge of honor. [we even look down on people who we donât think are as busy as us. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/518178/) this is all incredibly fucked. This is what this dystopia has done to us. And itâs so subtle. I donât think a lot of people consciously detect [this incredibly toxic mindset. ](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-the-glorification-of-busyness-impacts-our-well-being-4175360) because weâve all just normalized it. Weâve normalized it through mantras about hustling, grinding, hard work, etc. (even worse, those mantras are printed on merch for your stressed out lil ass to pay $25 of your hard-earned money to shitty businesses like F21 for.) whenâs the last time you saw a âmotivationalâ quote/mantra and felt inspired instead of shamed? The message being sent is âYou need to be doing more.â itâs time to ask yourself, who is profiting off of you being overworked? The answer is not you.When we glorify busyness we pressure ourselves to work like crazy. That is to our employersâ benefit. As the link above stated, we pressure each other to be busier.

I get paid to just sit here all day on my phone."" and she got this weird look on her face and said ""I don't think you're supposed to be telling your customers that."" Why not? Everyone knows. We're just not busy but we're required to be in the office all day just in case someone comes in. There's no extra work we can do and nothing to really clean. Why shouldn't I tell people I sit around all day doing nothing? To me that's an achievement but people like to act like it's supposed to be kept secret or something. Like somehow I shouldn't be proud of my job. Another thing people say a lot is that they'd never be able to do a job where they just sit around all day because it's too boring. They need to be working all day to make the day go by faster. That's the issue though. They don't like their jobs so they need a distraction to make it pass faster.

I usually ask them what the pay is like for their employees in case maybe it would be worth switching but so far it's either less than I make or such a small increase that it's not worth giving up a job where I do nothing.

600,"So I was living in this student apartment building which had 24hr reception staff. I decided to spend out to live in this ""luxury"" building because of course it was actually cheaper than the extortionate prices the university were charging for fewer facilities. Over the year I lived there I spent a good amount of time talking with the staff and getting to know more about the building. They would work 12 hour shifts in a 3 on 3 off pattern, but it switched from days to nights after every 6 shifts. They had to restock the shop, put out a breakfast platter, do the security checks, tidy all the communal areas and any manner of maintenance tasks, all without any breaks as the front desk could not be unmanned. They were only allowed to go into the parcel room to have a bite to eat before they had to come back. They were supposed to have two people working at all times but that was almost never the case. One day the two people who worked the 12 hour day shift had to stay and cover the night shift because the building manager didn't want to come in to cover, so one of them worked 16 hours and the other worked 12 then had a break to try and sleep in the spare apartment then work another 6.Anyway, the incident that made me want to share the story happened halfway into the tenancy. The staff were allowed to use the on site gym during their shifts as long as they kept it under half an hour, and as you can imagine with not being allowed actual breaks most of them took the opportunity . One night shift after completing all the tasks for the day the guy who had been working alone for the last 11 hours decided now that it was the quiet breaking down time he would go spend his half an hour in the gym before he had to set up for the day staff. He put all the necessary signs out so the residents knew where he was in case of an issue. He did everything right and yet the next day he was dragged into a disciplinary and fired for ""abandoning his shift"". In the time he was gone not one single person came to the front door or the reception desk. The food didnt run out and none of the machines broke down. There was absolutely no work to be done but he was fired with no hesitation.The company is a shitshow quite frankly, they used intimidation to get their way and when I questioned the legality of their tactics I was threatened with eviction. When I was moving out they then told me that I was taking too long and if I wasn't out of the building in the next hour they would call the police as I was ""trespassing"". Because of this I didnt have time to empty my bin and clean the oven and fridge before I left, so they took Â£370 out of my security deposit",ABoringDystopia,I know this isn't the normal type of post but I just remembered this thing that happened last year and know you'll appreciate it,jdhol67,2019-11-19 7:14,1

It exists and it affects corporate incentives for perfectly good reason.Had something happened to that employee, the bank very likely would be held liable. When they do things like this, it's because they are trying to act in accordance with their insurance policies, and just because it worked out this time, doesn't mean it will always be that way. By firing them (even if it is a poor pr move) they are signaling to other employees that they won't accept it.I tend to believe a more reasonable approach would be to acknowledge the employee did a good thing, but give a warning for why that stuff is against policy.We also don't have all of the facts.

We have no other information about the context of the termination, but it is very easy to rouse people on social media with these kinds of titleI'm not saying that is the case, but what I am saying is that I don't know, and very few other people probably do as well.It seems harmful to jump to conclusions so it fits a certain narrative, but it's almost like we can't not.

If I had to guess whatâs going on: your own auto insurance typically will NOT pay for your own medical expenses â when she went to the hospital her own *heath* insurance paid the vast majority of her costs (assuming she has health insurance) but she still has coinsurance, a deductible, etc, which means she might still owe many thousands of dollars. Normally, the other auto insurance company (the one representing the driver who caused the accident) would pay her back for these bills; the coworker would submit her claims to that insurance company, theyâd argue about whatâs fair, and possibly after a few months, theyâd cut her a check. (The coworkerâs health insurance company could possibly also have the option of subrogation for what theyâve paid).Since this dude has no auto insurance, her only option is to sue this guy for her out of pocket expenses. Problem is, that also takes a LOT of time, and if the dude didnât have auto insurance itâs unlikely he has thousands of dollars in the bank to pay her in a timely manner.Side note, this exact scenario is why âuninsured/underinsured motoristâ coverage exists.",ABoringDystopia,"A coworker got hit by a car one morning last week while walking to work, this was posted this morning.

767,"Bro, the American school system is perfect as it is. It operates under the lean project management principle when it comes to punishing kids and it's pretty efficient!i. They save money by (involuntarily) having their own budget reduced while having the town/city councilors allocate more money to the police department for SROs. In some cities, the SRO's salary is taken directly from the education budget. (Most people complain about public schools not getting adequate funding but money doesn't grow on tre...nevermind.)ii. Public schools also save a lot of time (which is money) when their students screw up and need to be punished. Why bother the parents, who probably love their jobs and hate being interrupted while they work? This is why we have SROs who just walk around, or better yet, are offered an office in the school...waiting to be called when a kid acts up.  Much more efficient. iii. We all know teachers are human beings. I know there are countless studies showing that racial microaggresions in the classroom has led to impartial reactions from our beloved teachers towards minority students when they act up compared to their fellow white classmates. But...there's only 24 hours in a day. Surely, you can't expect them to equally deal with every child; America will suffer if we ask them to do this. Also, think of the wait times for punishing the kids! Not only will it take much longer for kids to get punished, but it will reduce the severity of the punishments.  'No child left behind' was just a phase. We are in the end game now.

Production of farm animals will always be increased in the hope that the market price will improve, or to supply pigs to China , or this or that country, because they had to cull millions because of some disease, and you hope you can dump excess meat into other foreign markets etc. And since animals takes time to grow it is easier to keep that production going and if things go pear-shape it's easy enough to simply cull the herds than to let the market interfere.

Due to this pandemic, we have judges ruling that itâs appropriate to bar a married parent from their home and child because exposing a child to the risk of COVID-19 counts as âchild endangerment.â 2. Many essential employees would lose everything they own within 1-2 paychecks if they quit their jobs, due to intentional poverty-level wages, healthcare and life insurance being tied to jobs because only people earning money for the rich deserve health in America, and the rising costs of virtually everything. They have no alternative but to expose themselves to COVID-19 on a daily basis. Many of them are not provided with adequate â or even any â PPE. They are held in place by threat of starvation and financial ruin, told they should view this as their âcivic dutyâ by people who have retreated to the safety of their mansions, and lauded as âheroesâ â and of course they are, and always have been, by necessity of supporting families through their own blood, sweat and tears â but the word is used to cover up what they really are, and always have been: slaves and hostages. Refusing to enact UBI, rather than funnel a trillion dollars a day into banks and shovel yet more billions into the pockets of billionaires, America is perpetuating not only child endangerment, but a conscious and intentional genocide of the poor, and then scapegoating the poor themselves for not being better equipped to deal with the global pandemic they were:A.

So many incarcerations make the state money, as prisoners are required to perform labor and get paid an average of $0.02 - $0.10 an hour. Our local jails mostly use that for internal labor (maintaining the jail facility and providing inmate services like running laundry and chow, etc) and not all of those âjobsâ pay wages, theyâre done more for privileges - like extra time outside of a cell, extra blankets, and laundry twice a week instead of once. Our state prisons actually contract with private companies who use this labor. Victoriaâs Secret garments are manufactured by inmates in South Carolina (and two female inmates were placed in solitary confinement for months in the 1990s for telling journalists about it); AT&Tâs customer support line is answered by inmates in Arizona; Whole Foods has inmates in Colorado grow their produce, manage their farm fisheries and goat milk products; BP used prison laborers in Louisiana to clean up their toxic 2005 oil spill in the Gulf.

1010,"While I agree that for profit universities are a big problem (particularly for GIs and minority communities), I think a lot of this conversation conflates student poverty for tuition.Most in state public schools are affordable at the undergraduate level. Between free/low cost community college, in state scholarship, and merit aid, the vast majority of student loans go to cover the cost of living, not tuition.This is true for most private schools as well. When you see figures comparing the cost of tuition at Harvard in the past to now, that's mostly a misunderstanding of how tuition is actually priced. Middle class families do not pay sticker price. For many schools, families making under 60-80k don't pay a cent in tuition. Tuition rates are high as a progressive tax on wealthy alumni and legacies, and on international students. International students are not eligible for federal loans and generally pay the full cost of attendance out of pocket and up front.This raises the question: if universities aren't pocketing the money for shareholders and are charging the actual cost of operation, and if tuition is affordable for the majority of students, then why is student debt so hight?The real reason is the cost of living. Most students can't afford to work much, if at all since course work is so demanding. Even if they did work (say 20 hours a week which would be brutal), they can't pay the cost of living in cities or high demand college towns. This forces them to take loans for cost of living at incredible rates.If you were able to cut costs and save so much that you lived on a 10k a year, that's 40-60k in principle alone. Add in interest, rent hikes, extortionary book pricing and fees, and assume that the average student isn't so frugal and it's obvious where the real cost of student loans is coming from.The problem is not that ""free loans are allowing universities to rob us,"" it's that the rent is too damn high and welfare programs explicitly exclude students almost everywhere.Demonizing higher education is the goal of neoliberal policy makers. They want students and workers to see themselves and universities as the problem, not poverty. They want us to conclude that the liberal elites are fleecing us and that government policy that vastly increased university attendance and social mobility actually made the problem worse so that we won't do anything to improve our situation.Tldr: eat your landlord, not your dean.",ABoringDystopia,Murdered by War,High-Priest-of-Helix,2020-01-06 17:59,1

1078,"I don't know, I find myself to be dubious of these answers coming out of economic 'models,' particularly when it lacks what seems to be a clear mechanism of action.  Direct measurements often seem to show diametrically opposed results, e.g., [here](https://publications.iom.int/system/files/pdf/migration_policy_practice_journal_26_29june2016_final.pdf) on page 12.>According to a recent OECD study, one year following the end of the official introduction programme for new arrivals, which usually takes two years, only 22 per cent of low-educated men found employment. For women, the employment rate was a meager 8 per cent.  In a similar vein, a report by the Swedish Migration Studies    Delegation (Delmi) recently showed that only 30 per cent of all immigrants that arrived as refugees in 1997â1999 had a job after two years in Sweden, and even 10 years after their first arrival only 65 per cent were working.It's hard to believe that a population pool that takes 10 years to achieve 65% employment could be a net economic benefit.I'm also rather acutely conscious of the fact that it *does* provide a benefit to big business, by increasing the supply of unskilled labor and thus driving down wages.

As a consequence 1000s of people died based on violence against certain ethnic groups. In order to protect your citizens, bringing military was the optimal option at that point. Without it, the country was leading to a total chaos that may have led to the deaths of many more. Obviously there must have been other options along the way, but itâs possible those didnât work and military was the last resort.

[To quote Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_administration_family_separation_policy)>The Trump administration family separation policy is an aspect of US President Donald Trump's immigration policy. The policy was presented to the public as a ""zero tolerance"" approach intended to deter illegal immigration and to encourage tougher legislation.[1][2][3][4] It was adopted across the entire USâMexico border from April 2018 until June 2018.[5][6][7] >...By early June 2018, it emerged that the policy did not include measures to reunite the families that it had separated.[11][12] This created a child migration crisis.[13][14] Following national and international criticism,[15][16][17][18][19][20] on June 20, 2018, President Trump signed an executive order ending family separations at the border.[21][22][23] On June 26, 2018, US District Judge Dana Sabraw of the US District Court for the Southern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against the family separation policy and ordered that all children be reunited with their parents within 30 days.[24][25] Since June 2018, despite the official end of the separation policy, hundreds of additional children have been separated from their parents. In March 2019, the government reported that since that time, 245 children had been removed from their families, in some cases without clear documentation undertaken to track them in order to reunite them with their parents.[7][26] The House Committee on Oversight and Reform reported in July 2019 that over 700 children have been separated from their parents after the policy's official end.[27] In July, it was reported that as many as five children per day were being separated,[28] and by October, the total had reached 1,090.[29] I'm not even gonna touch the ""Shit holes"" hot take lmao that is just racist as fuck.",ABoringDystopia,When being racist is better then healthy food for kids.,SaintSchultz,2020-01-25 23:53,0

1226,"Troll harder.  You're missing the entire point of ACAB.  Doctors don't stick up for nor cover for bad doctors on a systemic level.  Doctors don't live by some unwritten rulebook that forbids them from speaking out against their bad colleagues.  Doctors carry their own malpractice insurance and the tax payers don't have to bankroll their lawsuit payouts.    Doctors don't purposely give substandard or no treatment to blacks and minorities that disproportionately results in their deaths.      Bad doctors get licenses revoked so they can't just pack up and get a job at the hospital in the next town or state.    Doctors don't have corrupt unions that make it harder for doctors to be held accountable for their actions.    Doctors actually have an education beyond high school.      Also, notice how you won't give those numbers as a percentage of how many people are actually treated by doctors every day.  I'm willing to bet the number of people getting medical treatment by doctors eclipses the number of interactions with police by a massive amount.  Oh wait, it does:    >In 2016, there were an estimated 883.7 million office-based physician visits in the United States (3,4).https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db331.htm    Yet here are the number of police interactions in a year:  >The portion of U.S. residents age 16 or older who had contact with the police in the preceding 12 months declined from 26% in 2011 to 21% in 2015, a drop of more than 9 million people (from 62.9 million to 53.5 million).https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=6406  Btw, that's only counting doctor visits, not interactions with doctors.",ACAB,ADAB,TheGreatMighty,2020-06-19 2:01,0

If your husband would've had the opportunity to a different, less oppressive job that could've sustained your family as well, then it would definetly be unjustifiable to chose the prison guard position instead.  But this is the absurd and bitter irony of capitalism, that it often forces working class people to team up with the oppressors and aid them in oppression of their own class, in one way or another, sometimes more overtly like as a prison guard and sometimes less obvious e.g. as someone who works for NestlÃ© and thus harms people in other countries. The main takeaway is that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism, but almost no ethical work as well.That said, I wish you and your family the best and I hope you can come by without actively partaking in the slavery system called prison, although I see that your husband does his best to undermine the oppressive nature of his function.",ACAB,Thin Colored Lines (labeled in comment),Grammorphone,2020-07-30 21:31,1

1886,"I don't know how to quote text yet.It doesn't ""make it ok"" but it's to provide a counter argument since people globally and at home like to call out America on being so racist we had to fight a war over it.As to the colonial era, technically that was a British policy of slavery. During the founding years of America they wanted to abolish slavery at the start, but southern states being farming cash cows relied on it heavily even then. The founding fathers needed all thirteen colonies to agree to make it work so they left slavery alone as a concession to states like Virginia and Carolina. Slavery wasn't as controversial back then. It was still completely normal globally. So for comparison, imagine some deal goin through congress(let's say to legalize the elixir of life that's recently been discovered, for fun) and the writer/sponsor tacked on free education. Well say for hypotheticals, New York doesn't like this because of all the money they make off of crazy taxes from colleges, so while it's there they won't sign the deal. So it gets cut. It would've been nice. It would've helped alot of people in the long run. But we have this main portion that NEEDS to go through. People are still doing fine paying for college so we'll get to that later.Short version: slavery was on the chopping block from the start. Concessions were made to keep the main idea going with a sticky note on it.As far as wage type slavery vs chattel slavery. Chattel slavery is what you think of when you think of slavery. People in the field. In the mines. Chained together. Not allowed to leave. Prisoners.Wage slavery is similar to the company store idea that American companies took up after wage slavery was outlawed. Wage slavery you aren't physically a prisoner but economic. Similar to feudal serfdom. You live in employer provided housing or the employer buys your neighborhood. You owe your employer so much that you HAVE to keep working for them and they can pay you what you want. Modern day example is the sweatshop. Anyway America outlawed this with chattel slavery while other countries kept it up into the 1920s.In regards to the company store thing I talked about, it was a workaround that made it ""voluntary"" so not technically slavery. It was usually done in remote places that you had to seek out vs wage slavery which was usually (not always) in industrial areas. Your 30-50 miles from the nearest town at a mine, a factory, a farm. Whatever. But the company you work for thought ahead and brought all the things you'd need from town to the company store. And you don't even need cash, this was one of the early uses of credit. Just put it on the company store bill. And then basically the company now owns you because you owe them so much, they control your wages, etc. You can leave whenever you want. After you pay your bill. To provide a counter point, occasionally a company store would do good like with Hershey during the DepressionEdit: in regards to your slavery dates, don't forget the last Confederate general to surrender was Native American, as well as some of the last people to give up their slaves as well",ActualPublicFreakouts,Heavily armed Black Panthers threaten car driver in Stone Mountain,devils_advocate24,2020-07-05 21:39,1
1887,">They owned slaves in all 13 colonies.It was all over. But the constitution required ratification by all the states. Many northern states were... More willing to give up the practice. The big one was Virginia that wouldn't give it up. >Yes, it may have been the norm, but history is recorded by the wealthy and the wealthy define normal from their perspectives, not the oppressedThis is true but the point stands that, at the time, even if it wasn't popular it was still considered acceptable. Over time views change of course. Burning people alive was ""acceptable"" at some point in history. Today we find it acceptable to make people pay for their own healthcare.>Please realize just because there is a law passed about something doesn't make it go away. A modem day example of this world not just be sweatshops, but most corporate jobs in America. Yes but passing the law is the first step. America took the first legal step was my point. And corporate jobs are nowhere near as bad as wage slavery. Most corporate jobs provide a middle class style of life. You have the option to quit and at worst you have to take a lower paying job and move to working class living. Wage slavery was you stop working you go to prison if you're lucky. It was even possible for the prison send you back to your employer to work for nothing at all now. In Dutch colonies they would cut off people's hands so they couldn't go anywhere else if they tried to quit. They actually just cut people's hands off alot in Dutch colonies.>Relevance? I don't know a lot about Natives participation in civil war history, but I do know that the nations were divided and fought for both armies.Eh you pointed out how Texas took a while longer.

1928,"This is how my dad bought his used audi a8L extremely extremely cheap. He had started working for a new company and his boss wanted him to drive a better car instead of his old construction van because it looks better to future clients. So his boss gave him $10k to put towards a new or used car. I helped him find a pretty nicely priced lexus at a BMW dealership. We went there and it wasn't as great as the pictures. We were about to go home when I spotted a 2006 audi a8L that was hidden inside the dealership (all the used cars were outside on the lot). I asked a salesman about it and he said they had just gotten it so it wasn't for sale. I told him to get the manager because if the price was good we would buy it on the spot all cash. We sit down with the salesman after he talks with the manager. Apparently the car wasn't for sale because it had ""frame damage."" I was positive the car hadn't had any major repairs done. So I didnt understand how there could be frame damage when the car looked perfectly fine. Anyway long story short I bugged the manager to put the car on a life to see the supposed frame damage. Well it turns out the previous owner(also the original owner) had accidentally driven the car on top of those small parking lot concrete bumpers/stoppers and scraped the paint off the frame as well as left some scratches on it. It had to be reported as frame damage because of a police report. He ended up trading it in for a brand new Alpina 7 series. We got a 2006 audi a8L with 56k miles fully optioned (except the wheels (it had the stock non optioned wheels)) for exactly $20k minus the taxes and registration/plate fees in 2010. We got a 4 year old $100k car with low miles for 20% of the original cost. The same car at other dealerships were going for double that at $40k-$50k. I started to look at carfax reports more closely now and compare it to the car to try and get good deals. Also we still have the audi to this day.
