1,I feel so much fear and anxiety all the time. I live in Oregon. My dad works in downtown Portland. He eats all the conservative propaganda and thinks Iâm an idiot for being concerned about the mysterious federal police force roaming the streets capturing people in vans.  My dad now due to people being laid off now has to essentially do security in addition to his job. Square in the middle of downtown Portland. Itâs a little worrying to me and especially my mom. Every day he sends me shit complaining about the protestors and will show me graffiti he has to clean up and anytime I show him police brutality he is gleeful and doesnât care. My mom is suicidal now too thatâs a new development. Things have escalated and our family is just really frustrated with how unempathetic he seems. I know that seems dumb but man things are hard right now and like Iâve  been suicidal since I was like 11 and Iâm 24 now. Thatâs not really relevant just like damn am Iâm having an extra bad time I was mentally strained before this. I need peace in my family. Does anyone have any links I can send or show my dad in person (when I text him he doesnât listen) to maybe change his mind?,2020PoliceBrutality,I need peace in my family.

7,"The primary purpose of this group is to showcase police brutality.I come from a mixed family (you name it, we got it). My grandmother is a person of color. I fear for my family every single time I hear about police violence.I called my grandmother to express this. It was the first time we had a real conversation about race. It was a  hard conversation to have - we weren't addressing my fears!She said, ""Dave, it is so dangerous being a black man in America. Don't personalize it.""And that's just it. I personalize a problem I shouldn't. That conversation helped me identify what I can - and should - take responsibility for. Identification is only the first step in the process of healing.I have to believe that it will get better. I have to believe in something bigger than mr. I have to relinquish control of the things I cannot. It is hard, especially when I believe I, myself, am the difference. It's not so simple...In fear, I lose track of who I am and the principles I live by. I have to take an honest, fearless look at myself. It is not easy, but helps with identifying my part. I need to share these things with someone I trust - anyone or anything, even the spiritual. I'm fortunate to have close friends and professionals I can discuss these things with and some conception of a Universal power that will listen. I learn more about myself when I listen to these things. I have to pray that the defaults of character which affect my usefulness to others can be removed, but first I have to be willing. Identifying what's what in this sense requires time and meditative practice. One way or another, I may have caused harm to someone else, and I need to be willing to make amends - and then do it. I'm not perfect, sometimes I slip. I should be accountable for such occurrences.In the meantime, I take a moment to pause and reflect - is there something I'm not doing? What is the next best thing - good orderly direction? How can I be of service How can I further connect with this Universal power?Lastly, I have to carry this on - to help those who are suffering. I don't know if this is the solution for you, but so far, it has worked for me.If you - any of you - have any questions, feel free to DM me.",2020PoliceBrutality,How do you cope with the emotions of subscribing to this sub?
