"So the US initiated the conflict on August 2, then lied and said something happened on August 4 so they could start a war. In general I'm pretty disgusted by US behavior. Genocide here, self righteous wars there. I feel bad for everyone still blinded by the propaganda. We did some good things in the past but from my learning it appears all the good deeds were to cloak the bad. I really hope millennials and gen z do a better job of governing.",2020PoliceBrutality,How do you cope with the emotions of subscribing to this sub?

Wow. That's amazing.  I hope the journey you have gives you the strength of character to stave off any bad influences when you get elected! I have done small leadership things and it is extremely rewarding. The sense of power I had intimidated me ever step of the way. In the end I was really happy I left that role before I became problematic so I don't know how I would behave in a long term situation yet. But I hope I do. I know I have the skills and grit to do long term leader things. All the best. Work hard! Don't give up! â¥ï¸,2020PoliceBrutality,How do you cope with the emotions of subscribing to this sub?

"Holy wow, thatâs an incredible accounting. I think I would feel the same anger myself. Itâs hard when people who are supposed to be for the public safety make you feel so violated. Hard to wrap your mind around tbh. Caregiver fatigue is what you are referencing when you say âI wanted to do more, but I couldnât handle it for a long period of timeâ, in my opinion. Caring, in general, in the face of such cruelty will definitely drain an empathetic person rather quickly. I ran an animal rescue for a couple years ago, and that definitely prepared me for the difficulty of this. I seem to have the ability to deal with almost anything as long as Iâm feeling like Iâm doing something about it. If Iâm sitting still the cruelty hurts me *far* more â I get stagnant and frustrated. My involvement in the project is what saves me. The team is legitimately such a positive influence in my life that Iâm grateful to be in such a positive environment, surrounded by like-minded people. This is what you might be looking for, like-minded people in a positive environment.
